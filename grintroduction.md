# Grintroduction

**The low-down on Grin coin, for real people who aren't geniuses.**

**TL;DR**: *Grin is different. It is fair, it is private, and it aims to be more fungible than non-privacy cryptocurrencies. The emission schedule and the inflation rate are predictable, but whether they are ideal is yet to be determined.*

Grin (GRIN) is new. The first Grin block was mined in January of this year, 2019. And, it's a bit different. Here's how:

**Fair and honest.**

Grin started out the way Bitcoin did...anybody could just start mining. There was no pre-mine. This means the folks who started Grin didn't get anything extra. Much of the time, if someone starts a coin, he'll pull one or two semi-scams. First, he might *pre-mine* a million-or-so coins for himself. The logic is, since he did the work to make the coin, shouldn't he reap a good chunk of the rewards? Or, semi-scam #2, he *sets up an ICO* and sells coins on an open market. He reaps rewards here as well in the form of cryptocurrency. Some might say, these are actually fair. And, I might even agree, assuming that everything was shown up front and done in the open. If done in the open, and someone wants to engage in the project, that's fine by me. 

Nevertheless, *Grin didn't play either the pre-mine or ICO game*. The Grin network simply went live. Anyone wishing to mine the coins could do so. Period.

A second tenet of Grin that makes it fair and honest is that the leaders seem determined to keep things in the open. All of their agendas, and meetings, and meeting notes are logged on Github or Gitter.im (chat system linked to Github). And,anyone with a GitHub account join there, weigh in with their two cents, or work on the code. It might seem odd for a privacy coin to be so transparent, but Grin appears to be.

**Privacy.**

Lots of folks think Bitcoin is "anonymous" or that criminals can get away with using Bitcoin because it can't be traced. Not so. There are privacy coins already, mainly Monero and Zcash. Grin's different. The most obvious difference is that *there are no addresses with Grin*. Kind of like how websites have addresses, such as google.com, cryptocurrencies have something similar. Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash and almost all cryptocurrencies have addresses that are long, unreadable bunches of letters and numbers. But, they are addresses. *Grin does not have addresses*. This absence of addresses means a couple of things:

First, by having no addresses, this means privacy. With Grin, *no one can see how much you have in your crypto wallet*. They can do that with Bitcoin. With Grin, *no one can see where that money came from, or where it went to*. They can do that with Bitcoin. With Grin, *no one can see how much money you sent or spent*. They can do that with Bitcoin. To be fair, Monero and Zcash, though having addresses, are private. Though you can see an address, you can't see how much is in that address or details about a transaction.

Secondly, by having no addresses, this means sending and receiving Grin money is different. The process is rather technical, and wouldn't be understood by most folks, myself included. But, I'll attempt *a conceptual explanation* here. 

Start with Bitcoin and think of Bitcoin wallets as glass piggy banks laying out in the open for all to see. Anyone can put money in. Only the piggy bank owner, with the private key, can unlock and take out the money. If they wished to do so, anybody walking by is free to drop coins into any Bitcoin piggy bank. The owner of that Bitcoin piggy bank does not need to be around or even know that money was dropped in. Grin is different. The piggy bank analogy does not exist. With no addresses, there are no piggy banks. Or at least, the piggy banks are out there somewhere, but no one knows where they are. They're magical, invisible, grinning piggy banks, somewhere out there in piggy bank land.

In order to make a transaction with Grin, both folks have to communicate. If I were to pay you in Grin, I must make contact with you and ask your permission. You must respond back to me. I ask, "Hey, want some Grin money, I'll send you 2 GRIN?" You say, "Yes, send it!" The software takes care of making things happen. It makes sure things are all legit and that there's no monkey-business going on. And, the software makes those 2 GRIN magically vanish from my invisible grinning piggy bank and show up in yours. Nobody else ever sees any of this.

The thought is that this might more closely mirror the real world. If Sally wanted to give some Bitcoin to a guy she's never met on the other side of the world right now, she could (which is nice). If Sally wanted to give some dollar bills to that guy, she could not. First, she would have to contact him, in some way, and ask, "Hey, I want to give you some money, where can I send it? Bank account? PayPal? Letter in the mail?" He'd need to respond back, etc. Grin works like this.

This process of sending/receiving money is certainly different from other cryptocurrencies, and it might take a bit to get used to. It seems a bit clunky, a bit unintuitive to me right now. My guess is that the Grin community will likely work on making this easier going forward.

**Monetary policy.**

A basic of money is the answer to the question, "How much money is out there?" This is the money supply. Too little money, people hold onto it. Too much money, it's worthless paper. Grin wants to be "better money." So, it takes a different view as compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a set quantity of 21 million. Grin has no set money supply. It will add 1 Grin coin per second forever. Grin's idea is that Bitcoin's money supply, being limited, discourages spending and encourages holding onto it in expectation of it going up in value. Again, Grin wants to be better money, so, it wants to make itself spendable. 

There are a couple of terms here pertinent and perhaps confusing. One is the *emission rate* and a second is the *inflation rate*. The emission rate is how fast/slow coins get created. The emission rate is 1 Grin per second (actually, it's 60 Grin per minute, which is when a new block is generated). *The trick is to find the Goldilocks emission rate*...not too limited like Bitcoin, maybe, not too fast that would make the currency worthless like the Bolivar, but just right. This Goldilocks rate would make Grin spendable and usable, and not worthless. By contrast to most cryptocurrencies' fixed emission schedules, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. plays money supply-god and tries to manipulate things to, hopefully, stay in the Goldilocks zone. 

Being crypto, Grin has opted against a centralized entity like a Fed managing monetary policy, and toward hard-coding the emission schedule. *There's no guarantee that 1/second is the magical Goldilocks emission rate*. It appears the logic here simply is that such a rate is simple to understand, is reliably predictable, and somehow seems natural. Maybe it even jives with the natural laws of physics and our circadian rhythm. I dunno.

The second term here is the *inflation rate*...how the value of the coin changes over time. A graph is helpful here. Whereas the blue graph for the emission rate is a straight line at 1/second, the red inflation rate graph looks like the Death-Dive Roller Coaster to Hell. Grin inflation started at 100%, then nose dives, then begins to curve a bit around 5 years in, then flattens to almost level. The near-flattening will take place in about 10 years, the flattening in about 20 or so (depends on how you look at it). By comparison, the red Bitcoin inflation rate is somewhat similar, but the blue emission schedule is not linear. Rather, the Bitcoin emission schedule is "humped over" as it slows, eventually to zero emission when no more Bitcoin will be created.

What's up with this shape of Grin's inflation nose dive? Simple Econ 101 math formula: inflation rate = ((new-old)/old)x100. Imagine...when the first Grin block was mined, BOOM! 60 coins existed. Pretend one Grin could buy you one cookie at the time. With the second block a minute later, 60 more Grin were added. The money supply just doubled from 60 to 120. The new-old is 120 minus 60, which is 60. That 60, divided by the old price of 60, is of course, 1. Times 100, is 100% inflation. Your 1 Grin now only buys half a cookie.

The result here is that early on, there's actually an incentive to spend Grin fast. I should have bought those 60 cookies in the first minute!

But the good news, again, is that the 100% inflation rate drops, and it drops relatively quickly. And, then it flattens. And eventually, the inflation rate goes to nearly zero. Think it through...adding 60 Grin to the first 60 was a huge jump. When there are billions of Grin coins already out there in the wild, adding a new 60 is almost like adding nothing new. 

As a personal note, the emission schedule and the inflation rate of Grin generate my largest hesitancy with the project. Will they work? Work well? Are they ideal? I don't know. The rates are understandable, which is always good, but I don't know the answer to those questions.

**Fungibility.**

This is a funny word. It's one of the properties of money (you can see others in this infographic: https://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/). It means that one coin is the same as any other coin. An old, crumpled up dollar bill is the same as a brand new one. 

Again, Grin sets the goal to be better money. That means better than cash, better than gold, better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is great, but one complaint that seems to be growing is that *one bitcoin may not be the same as another bitcoin*. Huh? The logic lies with the blockchain and how coins have histories. What if you got paid 1.0 bitcoin for your old car. Yay! Finally! But, then you look on the blockchain explorer and see that coin was part of an FBI drug-seizure/money laundering/international espionage/human trafficking scam. Although you're clean, you've got blood money on your hands, so to speak, and you're not nearly as excited about having sold your car. This is an odd irony of Bitcoin...one of its glories is in the transparency of the blockchain, which is also perhaps a weakness. 

Dollar bills also travel horrible places (we don't want to know where they've been) and facilitate horrible crimes and situations, but we don't know these things. So, fungibility of dollars is strong. We consider all dollars to be the same. Grin sets out to establish more fungible cryptocurrency by way of its built-in privacy. 

**Summary.**

Grin is different. It is fair, it is private, and it aims to be more fungible than non-privacy cryptocurrencies. The emission schedule and the inflation rate are predictable, but whether they are ideal is yet to be determined.
