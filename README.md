# grin-converter
This is my first attempt at an open source project. I figured it'd be good way to learn about GitHub.

Be nice.

This app simply gathers the current price of Grin and shows the fiat price in various Grin units. It uses the api at <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/grin/overview">CryptoCompare</a>.

A handful of fiat are available: USD | GBP | EUR | CNY | CAD | AUD | INR | JPY | KRW
